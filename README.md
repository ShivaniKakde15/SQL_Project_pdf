#### Note: SQL Mockup Data PDF file in master branch.

### Description:

#### In this project two tables are given with whole data, one is users and  second one is progress table. Firstly I saw the whole details of tables using select * from table_name command.

#### The Second query retrieves the email domains from the users table that end with '.edu', counts the occurrences of each domain, groups the result by domain, orders it in descending order of the count, and returns the top 25 results.

#### Third query  is to determine the count of rows in the users table where the city is specified as 'newyork'.

#### Fourth query is to determine the count of rows in the users table where the 'mobile_app' column is specified as 'mobile-user'.

#### Fifth query is to retrieve the 'sign_up_at' column from the users table along with the hour component extracted from it.

#### Sixth query is to retrieve data from the "users" and "progress" tables, and join them using 'JOIN' keyword, based on the "user_id" column.
